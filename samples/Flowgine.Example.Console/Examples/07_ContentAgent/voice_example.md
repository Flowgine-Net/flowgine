I just made a full walkthrough on how to train GPT or Claude to be a high-level ghostwriter (without any code or tools)  
it is designed to write like you \- not like AI  
– it learns your writing style, tone, vocabulary, and tweet structure  
– mimics how you phrase things so it reads like you wrote it  
– and most importantly, no setup headaches or weird prompts that sound robotic

I built an AI system that scrapes high-performing tweets in your niche and uses them to write tweets in your exact style...  
here’s how it works:  
– scrapes Twitter for top-performing posts and tracks engagement  
– uses AI to extract the hooks and categorize them by topic  
– generates new tweets using those proven hooks, written in your style, tone, vocabulary, and structure  
– stores everything in a database so you always have high-performing ideas to pull from

everyone’s obsessed with “autonomous AI agents” right now  
“it’ll do your entire workflow for you bro”  
no it won’t it’ll hallucinate steps, loop itself, and break quietly  
99% of tasks people want to automate can be done with a static AI workflow \- and that’s actually better...  
\- results are more consistent  
\- fewer guardrails needed  
\- more robust for real business use  
when you’re implementing AI inside a business, you want stable results  
variance is literally how systems break and how you end up constantly putting out fires

most AI chatbots break when you ask a question that requires info from multiple sources  
for example try asking:  
“which client contracts are finishing up this month?”  
you’ll get a half-answer — or none at all  
why?  
because traditional chatbots only look at small snippets of your docs \- they don’t understand how things connect across clients, services, timelines  
that’s where knowledge graphs come in  
they let you turn messy contracts into a web of relationships — like:  
"Client → Contract Type → Service Provided → End Date"  
so instead of guessing from a few chunks of text, your chatbot can search across all your clients and contracts to give accurate answers  
I made a full walkthrough on how I built this:  
– how to organize your contracts so an AI can actually use them  
– how to define what matters (like who signed what, and when)  
– how to get the AI to figure out what info it needs and where to find it  
– and how to feed that back into your chatbot so it gives accurate answers

everyone talks about prompts and LLMs when it comes to building AI systems  
but in practice, most of the real work happens outside the prompt  
it’s stuff like:  
– validation logic: is the LLM’s answer actually correct or just confident?  
– context management: what info are we feeding the model and is it even relevant?  
– memory handling: how are we tracking state across steps? storing past interactions? when do we retrieve vs forget?  
– error handling: what happens when something breaks or the model says “I don’t know”?  
– tracking outputs: are we logging responses so we can catch subtle issues over time?  
– debugging edge cases: why does it work on our test data but fall apart in the real world?  
prompting is just one part of the system  
the real challenge is giving the LLM the right context at the right time while making sure the whole thing doesn’t fall apart under pressure

one of the biggest mistakes I see with chatbots is stuffing them with too much context  
\> slack threads  
\> call transcripts  
\> SOPs  
\> emails  
all crammed into a single prompt just to answer one simple client question  
just because context windows are huge doesn’t mean you should throw a bunch of shit in there  
irrelevant noise just confuses the model and increases hallucinations  
then they wonder why the bot is ass and blame the model  
it’s not about adding more context  
it’s about adding the right context at the right time

# Tweet 7 

everyone talks about using AI to automate tasks  
but barely anyone talks about using it to make sense of messy information  
things like:  
– customer reviews  
– support logs  
– client contracts  
– meeting notes  
LLMs are great at taking this kind of raw text and turning it into clean, usable data you can actually work with  
for example:  
– tagging ecom reviews by issue type (product, shipping, support)  
– turning contracts into a table of who has what clause  
– extracting the most common objections from sales calls so you know what to pre-handle in your funnel  
– categorizing support tickets to identify top recurring issues  
and while everyone thinks big companies want AI just to save time  
what they really want is better data  
because better data \= better decisions

hallucinations are one of the biggest risks when using LLMs in production  
especially with chatbots — they’ll return a confident answer that sounds right, but is completely wrong lmaooo  
here’s how I reduce that risk:  
scope filtering (pre-RAG):  
\> before I retrieve context, I use an LLM to assess if the question is in scope if it’s not something the system is designed to handle, it exits early  
context-grounded validation (post-RAG):   
\> after generating a response, I run a second LLM call to check: “is this answer supported by the retrieved context chunks?”  
if not, I return a fallback message like:  
\> “I can’t answer that based on the info provided.”

everybody talks about building AI chatbots, but nobody tells you HOW to do it  
that's why I made a full practical walkthrough on how to build an AI chatbot that's hooked up to your own custom knowledgebase  
inside of the walk-through i go over:  
– data collection: gathering all relevant documents, conversations, and info  
\- preprocessing: cleaning up and formatting the collected data  
\- chunking: break down the cleaned data into smaller, manageable pieces  
\- embedding & storing in a vector database  
\- RAG & chatbot integration: using RAG to allow the chatbot to retrieve relevant information from the vector database based on a user's question

I just built an AI ghostwriter that is designed to mimic your unique voice (and no it won’t sound like an AI wrote it)  
here’s how it works:  
\- you give it a tweet request  
\- using NLP we finds similar tweets that you have previously posted about the same topic   
\- the AI learns the topic, your content structure, your vocabulary, everything   
\- we returns a tweet in the same fashion as if you wrote it yourself  
I recorded a walkthrough on how to build this yourself (including the code).
